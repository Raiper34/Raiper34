Hi, I am Filip Gulan, also known as Raiper34. I am mainly a Frontend engineer with over 5 years of industry experience. I have a master's degree in Bioinformatics and Biocomputing and I made some games during high school, which most popular is a game called Build a Snowman, a hardcore logic game. I love technology around web, I work with Angular, Nestjs for Web applications, or Ionic for mobile apps. I made some games in Phaser and sometimes I scrape webpages using Scrapy.
